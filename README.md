## Triva
<hr>
<ul>
<li>I coded a year ago a similar application in <b>C</b>, but it was before I backed up my personal projects, so it is most likely stuck on my old pc back in my home country</li>
<li>when I originally coded this project, I had so much stress coding it because it was my first time working with binary files, but at the same time it was one of my proudest projects</li>
<li>I mainly choose this as my first big rust project because I wanted to test rust's ability to work with binary files and to cast binary arrays to other data types</li>
</ul>
